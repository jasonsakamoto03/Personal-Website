            Now that I had the visual and interactive aspect of my project done, it was time to get into the logic of the game. I used a 2D array to represent the game board and used the same logic as my previous Connect Four project to check for a winner after every turn. I  check for vertical, horizontal and diagonal runs of four using nested for loops after every turn, if there is not, then the game continues unless there is a tie. I then used a series of conditionals and while loops to make sure the player's piece could only be played at the bottommost row in the column and so that nothing would happen if the user selected a full column. I used a boolean value to determine who's turn it is. Once there is a winner, a winner message is displayed. The logic of the game is complete and fully functional to play, my next improvements to this project include adding a undo button, further updating the visuals and adding extra messages to improve the originality.

            I wanted to create a simple project that showed off my knowledge of React.js. Inspired by the styling of the Tic Tac Toe tutorial React has on their website and by a past programming project from a class, I created a new React project and began using that to create my Connect Four game. I set up my index.html and style.css the same way as the React tutorial and created a 7x6 grid of boxes that filled with an X when you clicked on it.
