        <p>I sit down in a cafe I have never been to before with my vanilla latte on a cold December afternoon. I pull out my laptop and Ipad, totally in the zone to make massive strides on my personal coding project. Best of all, I am doing all this during my winter break, I made the decison to go to this cafe and be productive when I could have just stayed home and watched Youtube. Everything was set up for me to have the productive work session of my life, but then, I could not connect to the cafe's wifi for the life of me. I asked the employees, saw other people were able to use it, and fiddled around with the settings for 10 whole minutes. It might be a surprise to some that this actually ended up being one of my most productive work sessions despite this setback. How? I didn't let my environment affect how I spent my time and redifined what productivity meant at that time based off what was given to me.</p>

        <p>It would have been really easy to just get up and leave at that point considering I couldn't do anything I originally planned. But I then thought of the amount of time I would have wasted driving to the cafe and then having to drive back home. 30 minutes wasted not doing anything besides driving! I brainstormed ways to be productive and quickly found that there were tons of things I could do that did not require the internet. Reading, journaling, setting up my Notion page for my new quarter, or just practicing deep thinking and meditation. Things that we tend to deprioritize due to the stresses of our jobs or academics. I ultimately decided to read with my time as it was something I want to do more next quarter and there was no better time to get a start to that then that moment.</p>

        <p>What I subconciously did at that moment was  control how I used my time in the environment that was given to me rather than let it control me. This really made me think about how much time is wasted because the environments we are in are not ideal or planned out exactly how we intended them to. I encourage anyone that is reading this to be more intentional about the environments you are working in and how that affects your workflow. If you are able to leverage an ideal environment, that is great and you will probably accomplish a lot in that work session. But know that this will not always be the case and it will ultimately up to you to determine how you use your time.</p>
