            <h2>Happy 2024!</h2>

            <p>January 4th 2024</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Happy New Year everyone! I hope everyone has had a moment to reflect on their 2023 and gear up for all the great things in store for everyone for this upcoming year. As a person that is really big about making the absolute most out of the time we have been given on earth, New Years is a really important and exciting time for me. It hasn't always been this way though, I actually used to hate the idea that people looked forward to and celebrated the flipping of the calendar year. I used to view it as just flipping a new page on the calendar, or the sun rising for one of the 365 or 366 times it does every year. I think the time between years is ideal for setting and achieving goals and making significant progress towards becoming a better person.</p>

            <p>I believe that the best thing a person can do to set themselves up for a successful year is to reflect on the year they just had. What goals did you set for yourself? Did you achieve them? If not, what held you back? More importantly in my opinion, how did you develop as a person living on earth? We might not have reached all of our tangible goals for the year such as money or grades. Unexpected setbacks happen that prevent us from doing these things and that is totally okay, in fact they are actually good for us when looked at from the correct lense. This is why I tend to focus on the intangible, abstract goals. Goals about who you are to other people, how you feel about yourself, and what your purpose is. If we learn the lessons from these prompts about 2023, we will be better equipped to reach those tangible goals in the following years.</p>

            <p>While the tangible goals in life may seem to make one happier, this is hardly the case. When I walked out of my Physics Mechanics final, the hardest class I have taken in college thus far, I knew my grade wasn't going to be as high as it was in other classes. It wasn't a bad grade but was going to lower my overall GPA, but I felt apathetic to the idea of my grade. I felt more accomplished than I ever have before after reflecting all the hours I spent studying and trying to understand these concepts. I felt confident that I could tackle a lot more than I previously thought I could after taking this daunting class. By reflecting on the intangible goals I had for myself which was testing my discipline and discovering my limits rather than the tangible goals that is my grade, I felt a surge of confidence from the accomplishment. I urge everyone if you are not already to reflect on how you changed as a person in 2023 and how you want to improve in that sense in 2024. This will provide much more value and tell you more about your year than the tangible goals.</p>

            <p>This post was not to disrespect tangible goals, but to get you thinking about your priorities for the year. I beleive that with strong intangible goals and working on yourself as a person, the tangible things will come with patience and you will be able to enjoy those things to a greater extent</p>

            <p>Please, take your time when setting your goals. One thing that I feel holds people back sometimes is wanting to start making strides towards their goals right at the start of the year. I discourage this because it can lower the quality of the goals by not thinking them through and lead to them not really being what you want. My suggestion is to take action on the goals you know for sure or have thought of before, but take the entirety of January to think about and solidify what you want for yourself in the coming year. After 2 years of not really focusing on myself, I am pretty motivated for this year and really beleive that good things are coming for myself and everyone reading. Good luck!</p>
