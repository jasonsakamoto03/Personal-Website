            <h1>Overview</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>I grew up in Issaquah, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, and lived there all throughout grade school. I attended Issaquah High School and was heavily involved in the music program there as I have played violin since I was 9 years old. Throughout grade school I also really enjoyed mathematics as I really liked the problem solving aspect of it. When it came to applying to college, I ended up deciding to major in math because I knew it was something I loved enough to make a difference with.</p>

            <p>When I got to college, I decided to take computer science as an elective because it was highly reccomended to me and I thought it was a useful skill. Taking that intro class ended being a defining moment for my career as I saw the power of programming and loved writing code. After exploring different jobs and careers, I decided I want to pursue data science as I feel like it is a career that will utilize my strengths in math and computer science the best and is a career that can heavily influence positive change in things that I am passionate about.</p>

            <p
            >As I reflect on my academic journey, I wonder how I found my passion and why I even care about what I'm learning. I think about the 3 biggest interests I have had throughout my academic years: math, music and computer science. Broadly, what do they all have in common? I pondered this question for a while and after discussing with many people about what I think about and what I want to do with it, I found that the intersection between those three that I find the most passion in is communication. In all three subjects you are attempting to communicate ideas without using a spoken language, and to learn these subjects is to improve this communication. When I study math or computuer science, or practice my violin, I keep this idea of communication in mind. How will this be percieved? What am I trying to say beyond what is directly being presented to my audience? I hope to enhance my knowledge about these topics as I continue my education to get a deeper understanding of this connection between these ideas and find new intersections between these subjects that I can explore.</p>

            <p>The first time I ever swung a golf club was when I was in fourth grade and I never knew it would be such a big part of my life now. I golfed with my family thoughout my entire life but really started to take it seriously in my senior year of high school when some of my friends started getting into it as well. For the past two summers I have worked in the Pro Shop at Bellevue Golf Course where being in an environment with a lot of high level golfers has inspired me to elevate my game to its highest potential.</p>

            <p>My current handicap index is 15.4 (disgustingly high). Here is a What's In The Bag for any other golf junkies:</p>
